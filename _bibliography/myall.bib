	abstract = {This work aims to establish which theoretical properties of classical linear algebra techniques, developed in two different contexts, namely numerical linear algebra and data analysis, are maintained and which are lost when extended to low-rank tensors. In the numerical linear algebra part, we experimentally study the effects of rounding errors on an iterative solver (Generalised Minimal RESidual) and several orthogonalization methods (Classical and Modified Gram-Schmidt and Householder transformation, among others) when extended to tensors by the Tensor Train (TT) formalism. In all the considered algorithms, we introduce additional rounding steps, with the TT-rounding compression algorithm, to cope with memory constraints, which are always crucial when dealing with tensors. Our experimental tests suggest that for these algorithms, the classical bounds due to the propagation of rounding errors remain valid, replacing the accuracy of the arithmetic with that of the TT-rounding algorithm. In the data analysis part, we geometrically study the generalization of correspondence analysis to multi-way tables by the Tucker tensor decomposition technique, thus contributing to the understanding of Multi-Way Correspondence Analysis (MWCA). Examples of MWCA applied to datasets complement the theoretical results. In particular, we perform the MWCA on an original ecological dataset provided to us in the framework of the Malabar project of the BioGeCo (INRAE) and Pleiade (Inria) teams.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing has already proved its power in estimating plant biodiversity. Since plants reflect and absorb in a specific way sunlight, ecologists use multispectral photos to estimate plant biodiversity of a certain area through biodiversity indexes, e.g., Rényi's and Rao's index. Working with these big data is often expensive in terms of storage memory requirements. A possible solution is compressing multispectral data through tensor techniques, as {High Order Singular Value Decomposition}. We apply two recent variants of HOSVD to spectral images and we compute biodiversity indexes over the compressed data generated. For the Rényi index compressing data is extremely advantageous, since the information loss in estimating biodiversity is very low. For Rao's index the results are not as satisfactory, even if they are promising. Using approximatively 15\% of the original data information, in the first case we estimate an average error per pixel between 5.5\% and 7.5\%, while in the second case the average error per pixel is between 17\% and 19\%.},

We propose a new iterative scheme for symmetric and positive definite operators, significantly advancing methods such as truncated matrix-oriented Conjugate Gradients (cg). The new algorithm capitalizes on the low-rank matrix format of its iterates by fully exploiting the subspace information of the factors as iterations proceed. The approach implicitly relies on orthogonality conditions imposed over much larger subspaces than in cg, unveiling insightful connections with subspace projection methods. The new method is also equipped with memory-saving strategies.

abstract = {We study the solution of linear systems with tensor product structure using the Generalized Minimal RESidual (GMRES) algorithm. To manage the computational complexity of high-dimensional problems, our approach relies on low-rank tensor representation, focusing specifically on the Tensor Train format. We implement and experimentally study the TT-GMRES algorithm. Our analysis bridges the heuristic methods proposed for TT-GMRES by Dolgov [Russian J. Numer. Anal. Math. Modelling, 28 (2013), pp. 149-172] and the theoretical framework of inexact GMRES by Simoncini and Szyld [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 25 (2003), pp. 454-477]. This approach is particularly relevant in a scenario where a (d+1)-dimensional problem arises from concatenating a sequence of d-dimensional problems, as in the case of a parametric linear operator or parametric right-hand-side formulation. Thus, we provide backward error bounds that link the accuracy of the computed (d+1)-dimensional solution to the numerical quality of the extracted d-dimensional solutions. This facilitates the prescription of a convergence threshold ensuring that the d-dimensional solutions extracted from the (d+1)-dimensional result have the desired accuracy once the solver converges. We illustrate these results with academic examples across varying dimensions and sizes. Our experiments indicate that TT-GMRES retains the theoretical rounding-error properties observed in matrix-based GMRES.},

However, measuring species diversity over large areas might be difficult for logistic reasons related to both time and cost savings for sampling, as well as accessibility of remote ecosystems. In this paper, we present a new R package - rasterdiv - to calculate diversity indices based on remotely sensed data, by discussing the theory behind the developed algorithms. Obviously, measures of diversity from space should not be viewed as a replacement of in situ data on biological diversity, but they are rather complementary to existing data and approaches. In practice, they integrate available information of Earth surface properties, including aspects of functional (structural, biophysical and biochemical), taxonomic, phylogenetic and genetic diversity. Making use of the rasterdiv package can result useful in making multiple calculations based on reproducible open source algorithms, robustly rooted in Information Theory.},

	abstract = {The majority of work done to gather information on the Earth's biodiversity has been carried out using in-situ data, with known issues related to epistemology (e.g., species determination and taxonomy), spatial uncertainty, logistics (time and costs), among others. An alternative way to gather information about spatial ecosystem variability is the use of satellite remote sensing. It works as a powerful tool for attaining rapid and standardized information. Several metrics used to calculate remotely sensed diversity of ecosystems are based on Shannon’s information theory, namely on the differences in relative abundance of pixel reflectances in a certain area. Additional metrics like the Rao’s quadratic entropy allow the use of spectral distance beside abundance, but they are point descriptors of diversity, that is they can account only for a part of the whole diversity continuum. The aim of this paper is thus to generalize the Rao’s quadratic entropy by proposing its parameterization for the first time. Innovation The parametric Rao’s quadratic entropy, coded in R, (a) allows the representation of the whole continuum of potential diversity indices in one formula, and (b) starting from the Rao’s quadratic entropy, allows the explicit use of distances among pixel reflectance values, together with relative abundances. Main conclusions The proposed unifying measure is an integration between abundance- and distance-based algorithms to map the continuum of diversity given a satellite image at any spatial scale. Being part of the rasterdiv R package, the proposed method is expected to ensure high robustness and reproducibility.},

To address these difficulties, we extend the FEAST algorithm, which is based on contour integration and traditionally applied to Hermitian eigenproblems, by integrating it with the Tensor-Train (TT) decomposition. This combination allows both operators and eigenvectors to be efficiently represented in TT-format, significantly reducing storage and computation requirements. We propose an adaptive strategy to determine the dimension of the projection space by integrating a rank-revealing Modified Gram-Schmidt procedure with pivoting adapted for TT-vectors. A perturbation analysis provides an explicit bound for the attainable residual accuracy, leading to a stopping criterion for the TT-FEAST algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a continuation procedure that progressively refines convergence and rounding thresholds, effectively managing memory growth during computation. The proposed algorithm is applied to high-dimensional problems, including the Laplacian operator and the vibrational Hamiltonian, demonstrating high efficiency and accuracy. We validate our results by comparing them with an analytical solution for the Laplacian operator and with an existing TT-based method for computing minimal eigenpairs for the vibrational Hamiltonian.},

Considering data may be compressed to alleviate the memory footprint, we are interested in the situation where the leading part of the rounding error is related to the data representation. When the data representation of vectors introduces componentwise perturbations, we show that the existing backward stability analyses of MGS-GMRES and Householder-GMRES still apply. We illustrate this backward stability property in a practical context where an agnostic lossy compressor is employed and enables the reduction of the memory requirement to store the orthonormal Arnoldi basis or the Householder reflectors. Although technical arguments of the theoretical backward stability proofs do not readily apply to the situation where only the normwise relative perturbations of the vector storage can be controlled, we show experimentally that the backward stability is maintained; that is, the attainable normwise backward error is of the same order as the normwise perturbations induced by the data storage. We illustrate it with numerical experiments in two practical different contexts. The first one corresponds to the use of an agnostic compressor where vector compression is controlled normwise. The second one arises in the solution of tensor linear systems, where low-rank tensor approximations based on Tensor-Train is considered to tackle the curse of dimensionality.},

	abstract ={This paper presents an extension of Correspondence Analysis (CA) to tensors through High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) from a geometric viewpoint. Correspondence analysis is a well-known tool, developed from principal component analysis, for studying contingency tables. Different algebraic extensions of CA to multi-way tables have been proposed over the years, nevertheless neglecting its geometric meaning. Relying on the Tucker model and the HOSVD, we propose a direct way to associate with each tensor mode a point cloud. We prove that the point clouds are related to each other. Specifically using the CA metrics we show that the barycentric relation is still true in the tensor framework. Finally two data sets are used to underline the advantages and the drawbacks of our strategy with respect to the classical matrix approaches.},
