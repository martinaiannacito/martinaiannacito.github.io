I am a postdoctoral researcher in the numerical analysis group at the [Departement of Mathematics of Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna](https://matematica.unibo.it/it/index.html). My research area is **numerical linear algebra** and **scientific computing**. I am particularly interested in **tensor-based algorithms**
and **finite precision arithmetic**. In 2024, I joined the 2022 PRIN project [Low-rank Structures and Numerical Methods in Matrix and Tensor Computations and their Application](https://prinum22.cs.dm.unipi.it/). My work is supervised by Prof. [Valeria Simoncini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/valeria.simoncini), Prof. [Davide Palitta](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/davide.palitta) and Prof. [Michele Ruggeri](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.ruggeri). The project focuses on <em>matrix and tensors equations for PDE, low low-rank approximation and data science applications</em>. Between May 2023 and March 2024, I was a research fellow in the Science, Engineering and Technology group at the Kulak campus of [KU Leuven](https://kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/). I worked on the development of numerical algorithms for computing the <em>Canonical Polyadic tensor Decomposition</em>


In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Inria Center of the University of Bordeaux](https://inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-bordeaux) under the 
supervision of Prof. [Olivier Coulaud](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/coulaud/) and Prof. [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/), both members of the [Concace](https://concace.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
research team. In my Ph.D. thesis, I conducted experimental research on the <em>Generalized Minimal RESidual</em>
method adapted to the <em>Tensor Train</em> format.  I paid particular attention to parametric problems and also addressed the issue of the <em>loss of orthogonality</em> of common orthogonalization kernels extended to the tensor framework. This linked classical finite precision arithmetic theoretical results with tensor experimental results. The thesis comprises two studies on <em>data science</em> problems, that were developed in collaboration with an ecological and climatology research team.
