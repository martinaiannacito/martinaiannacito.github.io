I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Science, Engineering and Technology group at the 
Kulak campus of [KU Leuven](https://kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/). My research area is **numerical linear algebra** and **scientific computing**. I am particularly interested in **tensor-based algorithms**
and **finite precision arithmetic**. Currently,I am working under the supervision of 
Prof. [Lieven De Lathauwer](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=22) on developing a numerical algorithm for computing the <em>Canonical Polyadic</em> tensor <em>Decomposition</em> and a generically unique rank-1 matrix factorization.

In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Inria Center of the University of Bordeaux](https://inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-bordeaux) under the 
supervision of Prof. [Olivier Coulaud](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/coulaud/) and Prof. [Luc Giraud](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/team-members/luc-giraud/), both members of the [Concace](https://concace.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)
research team. In my Ph.D. thesis, I conducted experimental research on the <em>Generalized Minimal RESidual</em>
method adapted to the <em>Tensor Train</em> format.  I paid particular attention to parametric problems and also addressed the issue of the <em>loss of orthogonality</em> of common orthogonalization kernels extended to the tensor framework. This linked classical finite precision arithmetic theoretical results with tensor experimental results. The thesis comprises two studies on <em>data science</em> problems, that were developed in collaboration with an ecological and climatology research team.
